_A test Rating App_
This is my first probe-app for collecting visitors feedback using an Interactive Optoma Displays.
The App has several screens:
1. Voting screen - features seeveral Emoji smileys that correspond to rating value from 1 to 5
   - the screen has a moving backround to prevent LCD matrix from burning out
   - the smileys buttons are oscilating also to prevent the burn out
   - pressing each button adds a record of timestamp / place / rating
   - upper left corner features a big button in form of Optoma Logo ( registered trade mark of Optoma Europe Ltd ) to reach Results and the menu with App settings
  
2. Results Screen - to display a bar diagram and gives acccess to the settings menu
3. Settings Screen offers such options as setting up the location to be displayed in the statistics and export data as a CSV-file
   - there maybe needed an additional file browser app for the host system, depending on the type/version.
  
TODO's / potential for improvement
1. Add custom logos als alternative to the Optoma logo
2. Add custom backgrounds instead of a statically assigned looped video
3. add filter options to the results screen to filter by time span and / or location
4. connect the app with the cloud real-time database for remote monitoring and data analytics
5. Add PIN-protection for leaving the voting screen
